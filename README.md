# spring-boot-practice
Project for practicing Spring Boot and API creation

This is a project space for practicing new concepts with Spring Boot and Database connections, and will be a mix of concepts I've learned through college and bootcamp lessons and self-taught information I have learned. This allows for people to view the ideas I am currently practicing. I may set this repository to private in the future.
